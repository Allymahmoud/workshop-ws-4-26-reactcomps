Ant Design (https://ant.design/docs/react/introduce) is a React UI library with components you can use in your React app.
We will be using Ant Design to make a landing page based on https://www.airbnb.com/ (view in incognito mode).

We will implement:
* nav bar
* carousel with pictures
* search bar with autocomplete
* cards

git remote add starter yourStarterName
git pull starter master
